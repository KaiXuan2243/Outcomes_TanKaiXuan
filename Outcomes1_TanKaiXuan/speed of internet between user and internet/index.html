		Nowadays the internet is important for every user actually is internet speed because if a device woking without internet or low speed internet will affect its work efficiency. For calculate the sped normally most people will think that Mbp/s is mega bype per second, but no, Mbp/s is mega bits per second, for easy to identify they use "B" for byte and "b" for bits. When the file size is larger, the download time is longer, but it also depends on speed of internet.
