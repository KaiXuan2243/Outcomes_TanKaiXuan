			Hyper Text Markup Language is a markup language for web developer to create the webpage. It is a structure box of all webpage. User can use HTML to embed image, object and create the interative form, than let the website display and explain the content that developer want to present. While HTML5 is fifth version of HTML, it also the latest, final and complete version of HTML in the standard of W3C(Worls Wide Web consortium). The aim of HTML5 is to improve the language by support to the latest multimedia and let user easily to reading. But the evolution of HTML to HTMl5 also cause some different between them.The first is HTML5 added some new elements and attribute that is html dosn't have, such as header, footer, nav, audio, video, main，charset, asign and pin. at the same time they deprected the elements like center, font and strike, it can help developer to definition important content. second is HTML5 try to support for vector graphic and replace Flash and Sliver Light. So it can play the video and audio wthout plug-in- browser. Third is the the DOCYTYPE in HTML5 is shorter and simple than HTML, it will let user and computer easy to read, and it also easy to cross-platform for example, if the game is created by HTML5, it can easy to transplant to another open-platform such as UC browser. Although HTML5 is better than HTML but it also has limination. First is about it's sercurity is weak and it still has loophole. The webpage created by HTML same with another language of webpage easy to reveal sensitive data. Because HTML5 is a new thing, so its technical not mature and HTML5 still too young to replace Flash  wheter audio or video. Some of the browser cannot support HTML5 maybe the browser is older or no this function. Every web browser used the kernel is not same, so their compatibilities also different with each other.
